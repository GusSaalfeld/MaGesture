## My Contribution
As programmer, I implemented a robust and reusable entity system, focusing heavily on good inheritance and software architecture. This was done with the aim of improving my own skills as a software engineer, as well as create an efficient pipeline for quickly creating new enemy types. I also sought to achieve safer and more efficient practices by leveraging coroutines and not using the scene inspector to link game objects. For recruiters looking at this repository to review the quality of my code, I would recommend the following sequence of files:

1.  Damageable (Class that both enemies and player defenses inherit from):
    LINK
2.  Enemy (Implemented then refractored multiple times until it was robust):
    LINK
3.  Enemy Bomber (Demonstrates the ease of changing enemy functionality via proper inheritance): 
    LINK

DAMAGER?

4.  Game Manager?:
5.  HMM?:

Note: All my code is in the Enemies folder.


Include images?

## Notice
Only the script folder of the project is shown here. This is since much of the project employed LFS, something our team can no longer afford, much of the project files irrelevant to my work have been deleted.
